            <div class="heading2">Nutrition for Runners</div>
            <div class="para1">Running as a form of sport and exercise has very particular nutritional requirements. To get the best in performance, endurance and recovery out of your body, you will need to be concentrating on not only what you eat but when you eat. It goes without saying that once you start running your body will need extra fuel for those miles. You will be burning an extra 100 calories roughly for each mile that you run. Not only that, your muscles will be needing extra protein to keep them operating efficiently. Follow these nutrition tips to improve both your speed and stamina.</div><br><br>
            <div class="para2"><b class="type2">Complex carbohydrates</b><br>They provide slow and steady fuel. Complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, whole breads and unrefined pastas, vegetables and potatoes will not produce the sharp blood sugar spikes and lows, which can leave you feeling depleted before the end of your run.</div><br><br>
            <div class="para3"><b class="type2">Glucose drinks</b><br>They should be consumed in the first 15 minutes after finishing your run will be best absorbed for muscles seeking fuel sources. The 15-minute time frame is important, as this is when your muscles can utilize it best.</div><br><br>
            <div class="para4"><b class="type2">Protein</b><br>It is essential for both tendon and muscle repair. Proteins are also essential for regulating hormones. The more often you run and the further distance you cover, the more repair work there will be for your muscles. An easy guide to remember is that if you are running a great distance you will need up to 1.5 grams of protein for every kilogram that you weigh.<br><br>So if you weigh 140 pounds, or 64 kilos, you will need about 96 grams of protein daily. Your protein should be high quality and preferably lean, such as chicken, tofu, eggs, nuts, or fish, if you are also trying to shed a few pounds. For those runners who do not have a weight problem, low fat protein will not be a concern.</div><br><br>
            <div class="para5"><b class="type2">Fats</b><br>Monounsaturated fats such as olive oil, flax seed oil, canola oil, and avocados are the healthiest fats to consume. Monounsaturated fats have been linked to a decrease in heart disease and stroke, and are one of the basic ingredients of the Mediterranean Diet. It is healthier for a runner to obtain their fat calories from these sorts of fats and oils than from unhealthy options such as lard or deep-fried anything.</div><br><br>
            <div class="para6"><b class="type2">Balanced meals</b><br>Balanced Meals for runners should comprise roughly 20 percent fats, 60 percent complex carbohydrates and 20 percent proteins. Ensure that you consume plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. Fruit smoothies are also an excellent and quick source of nutrition. A good variety of colorful foods should almost make a vitamin pill unnecessary.</div><br><br>
            <div class="para7"><b class="type2">Water</b><br>Consumption of water is essential for everyone, but even more so for the runner who is going to sweat more than average. A good rule of thumb is to aim for at least two liters, or eight cups, per day. Herbal teas, sports drinks, and fruit juices, can be counted as fluids, but be warned that caffeine and alcohol do not, as these will dehydrate you. Water should be consumed evenly throughout the day to keep fluid levels up and your body evenly hydrated. Most runners tend to be dehydrated.</div><br><br>
            <div class="para8"><b class="type2">Vitamins and minerals</b><br>They will play an important factor in your running performance and endurance. Your extra energy requirements will also mean that you will need extra vitamins and minerals. Ideally, these should be provided from a healthy and well balanced diet of fresh and whole foods. Bottled supplements will never replace a healthy and varied diet, and should only ever be considered as an extra, not a necessity.</div><br><br>
            <div class="para9"><b class="type2">Conclusion</b><br>As a rule, runners need to consume more calories than the non-runner. The consumption of good quality protein is vital for muscle repair, as is a steady supply of complex carbohydrates. Beware of empty calories that will only provide you with a sugar high and slump. Optimized running performances are dependent on consuming quality foods in a larger quantity, as well as careful timing of when you eat.</div><br><br>
